# End-To-End Machine Learning Project

## Purpose
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, covering data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It is designed to provide a structured and practical approach to building ML models from scratch.

## Project Structure
```
End_To_End_ML/
│-- data/               # Raw and processed data
│-- notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
│-- src/                # Source code for data processing and modeling
│-- models/             # Trained models and saved weights
│-- results/            # Evaluation metrics and outputs
│-- requirements.txt    # Dependencies for the project
│-- main.py             # Entry point for executing the ML pipeline
│-- README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Necessary Commands
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AdanALalawni/End_To_End_ML.git
   cd End_To_End_ML
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the main pipeline:**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
5. **Run Jupyter Notebook (optional for analysis):**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
