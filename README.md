# End-To-End Machine Learning Project

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, covering data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It is designed to provide a structured and practical approach to building ML models from scratch.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdanALalawni/End_To_End_ML.git
   cd End_To_End_ML
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the Flask application for model deployment:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Results

The project includes a trained machine learning model deployed via a Flask web application. Users can interact with the model through the web interface to make predictions.
